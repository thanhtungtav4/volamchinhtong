A redirect is a simple way to re-route traffic coming from a Requested URL to a different destination URL.

A 301 redirect indicates that the page requested has been permanently moved to the Destination URL, and helps pass on the Requested URLs traffic in a search engine-friendly manner. Creating a 301 redirect tells search engines that the Requested URL has moved permanently and that the content can now be found on the Destination URL. An important feature is that search engines will pass along any clout the Requested URL used to have to the Destination URL.
